# WhatsApp's decision to force its 2 Billion users to share their data with Facebook or be kicked off the app

In this document, I'll talk about the WhatApp's decision to force its users to share their data with its parent company, Facebook. The first post I'll share is of post on the day of the decision echoing the sentiment of many users' dissent to the decision. The second post I'll share is of WhatsApp and their response to the poor reciption of their decision.

## Article 1

In ArsTechnica's [WhatsApp gives users an ultimatum: Share data with Facebook or stop using the app](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2021/01/whatsapp-users-must-share-their-data-with-facebook-or-stop-using-the-app/), they react to the news of WhatsApp's decision to change their privacy policy. They point out the contradiction of how WhatsApp claimed to be the most privacy-focused product offering of the Facebook apps but now they're giving their 2 billion users an ultimatum: share their data with Facebook or delete their accounts.

This policy change was delivered via an in-app alert asking for users to push "Agree" to opt-in. Users had until February 8th to do so or they'd risk no longer having access to the app. The policy stated that, â€œAs part of the Facebook family of companies, WhatsApp receives information from, and shares information with, this family of companies." Given this statement, Arstechnica argues Facebook may also share users' data with outside entities like third-party businesses.

Arstechnica recommends readers to use an alternative messenger, such as [Signal](https://www.signal.org/).

## Article 2

In Cnet's [WhatsApp responds to concerns over privacy policy update](https://www.cnet.com/news/whatsapp-responds-to-concerns-over-privacy-policy-update/), they detail WhatApp's response to the onslought of users condemning WhatApp's decision to force their 2 billion users to accept sweeping changes to their privacy policy and terms of service. Many users have publicly called for others to not use WhatsApp anymore and switch to privacy-focused alternatives like Signal and Telegram; Most notably, [Elon Musk](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1347165127036977153?s=20).

WhatsApp made a few arguments to why their new policies and terms might be beneficial to users. One benefit they claimed was having better targeted Facebook ads. Another benefit is the ability to talk to businesses via WhatsApp and allow them to use that data for their marketing. Lastly, the Head of WhatsApp at Facebook Will Cathcart asserted that WhatsApp will still be end-to-end encrypted. He tweeted on Friday: "With end-to-end encryption, we cannot see your private chats or calls and neither can Facebook. We're committed to this technology and committed to defending it globally."
